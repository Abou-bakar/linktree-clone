LinkTrim
LinkTrim is a lightweight, privacy-conscious link management platform that lets users create and share personalized collections of links — no sign-up required. It's ideal for individuals who want to quickly generate a simple, shareable link page using a unique handle.

Project Description
LinkTrim is built for simplicity and speed. Unlike traditional link management tools, it does not require account registration. Users can instantly generate a public-facing link page simply by creating a unique handle (e.g., /john-links) and adding their desired links. All data is stored securely in a MongoDB database.

This project is ideal for developers looking to contribute to open-source tools that prioritize user privacy, fast UX, and modern web development standards.

No Account Required – Skip sign-ups, passwords, and email confirmations.

Handle-Based Sharing – Share your page at localhost:3000/[your-handle].

Simple & Intuitive UX – Designed for speed and ease of use.

MongoDB Storage – All link collections are stored in a flexible document database.
